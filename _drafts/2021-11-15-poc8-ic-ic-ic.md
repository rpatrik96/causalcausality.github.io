We will talk about IC, $IC$, and ${IC}^*$ in this post. You get the difference.

# Inferred Causation

It is time to see some causal discovery algorithms. There is one last thing before that though: we need to formulate when a node $C$ is the cause of node $E$. In the fully observed case, it is the existence of a directed path from $C$ to $E$. When latents are present, the we cannot use the same definition. Its extension is called the principle of **inferred causation**.


>Given distribution $\hat{P}$, node $C$ has a causal influence on node $E$ if and only if there exists a directed path from $C$ to $E$ in _every minimal latent structure consistent with_ $\hat{P}$.
>$$ 
\forall L, L' \in \mathcal{L},\  L \preceq L',  \exists \theta_G : P_{[O]}(<G, \theta_G>)=\hat{P} \\ 
\exists p = C\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow E \in L
$$

Inferred Causation is a more strict requirement than the sole existence of a $C\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow E$ path. It demands such a path in every minimal latent structure consistent with $\hat{P}$.

**Consistency is a necessary condition,** as we need to represent $\hat{P}$. As we are concerned with $\hat{P}$, we need to focus on that. Failing to find a directed path in consistent structures means that we cannot conclude a causal influence.

**Minimality is a sufficient condition,** as there is no need to restrict ourselves to minimal structures. We even get new information about those non-minimal structures if we investigate them. For they have a minimal counterpart, deciding whether there is a directed path in a non-minimal structure (which there is, as a non-minimal graph has at least the same edges to be able to express at least the same distributions) will not affect our conclusion about whether $C$ influences $E$.


# The Inductive Causation $(IC)$ algorithm

After having dived into the intricate details of causal models and latent structures, we can analyze the first algorithm for causal discovery.

The Inductive Causation $(IC)$ algorithm tackles causal discovery without latent variables. Although **when assuming stability, there will be a unique minimal causal structure, this only holds up to Markov equivalence**.

This means that IC cannot identify the ground truth graph, it will only output a pattern.

> A **pattern**  $H$ is a graph with both directed and undirected edges. In our context, it is used to express Markov equivalence classes.

The algorithm works with separating sets to determine conditional/marginal independence.

>A **separating set** $S_{ab}$ is a subset of variables $V$ in DAG $G$ if $a\perp b \| S_{ab}$ holds.  It is minimal, if no vertex can be removed from $S_{ab}$ so that $a\perp b \| S_{ab}$ still holds.

## Algorithm

**Input:** $\hat{P}$, a stable distribution on a set $V$ of variables.

**Output:** a pattern $H(\hat{P})$ compatible with $\hat{P}$.

**Steps**

  1.  $\forall a, b \in V$, search for a set $S_{ab} : a \perp_{\hat{P}} b \| S_{ab} $. Construct an undirected graph $G$ with $a-b$ if and only if no set $S_{ab} = \emptyset$.
  2. For each $a-c-b$, check if $c \in S_{ab}$.
      - If it is not , then $a\rightarrow c \leftarrow b$.
  3. In the resulting PDAG (Partially Directed Acyclic Graph), orient as many of the undirected edges as possible subject to:
      - No new v-structures and
      - No directed cycles.

For doing causal discovery, **we start with a (stable) distribution** - stability is required to rule out functional independencies (independencies introduced by the parameters of the SEM but not present in the ground-truth graph). 

Acknowledging that the output is a pattern, we face the reality of causal discovery: it is not guaranteed that we able to recover the ground truth graph. Nevertheless, we can recover it up to its Markov equivalence class.

**Step 1** constructs the skeleton of the graph. This is done by carefully checking conditional independence for all combinations of nodes and separating sets. ($IC$ is agnostic to how this is done; e.g., we can use conditional independence tests) In the case of $n$ nodes, we have ${n\choose 2}$ combinations for $a,b$ with $2^{n-2}$ possible separating sets for each. Multiplying the two gives us the sad reality of $45\times 256 = 11,520$ conditional independence tests in the worst-case scenario (we don't need to make all tests if one already indicates conditional independence).

**Step 2** identifies v-structures by checking whether the common neighbor $c$ of _nonadjacent_ nodes $a, b$ is in the separating set. Because we know that $c$ is connected to both, the only explanation for $c$ not being in $S_{ab}$ is that $c$ is the middle node of the v-structure $a\rightarrow c \leftarrow b$ - i.e., it introduces dependence between $a$ and $b$.

**Step 3** gives us general guidelines how we should orient the remaining edges, but it does not provide concrete means for it. We can introduce neither new v-structures (as step 2 should have identified all) nor directed cycles (as we look for DAGs). 

>Depending on the task, we may not be able to orient all edges.


### The four rules of Step 3
It was shown in the literature that with four simple rules, we can orient the maximally possible edges.

1. **Rule 1:** Orient $b - c$ into $b \rightarrow  c$ whenever there is an arrow $a \rightarrow  b$ such that $a$ and $c$ are nonadjacent.
2. **Rule 2:** Orient $a - b$ into $a \rightarrow  b$ whenever there is chain $a \rightarrow  c \rightarrow  b$.
3. **Rule 3 **: Orient $a - b$ into $a \rightarrow  b$ whenever there are two chains $a - c \rightarrow  b$ and
$a - d \rightarrow  b $such that $c$ and $d$ are nonadjacent.
4. **Rule 4:** Orient $a - b$ into $a \rightarrow  b$ whenever there are two chains $a - c \rightarrow  d$ and
$c \rightarrow  d \rightarrow  b $such that $c$ and $b$ are nonadjacent.


# The $IC^*$ algorithm

Identifying the separation sets and orienting the edges of v-structures is the same, the difference is that IC* does not orient edges but adds arrowheads.

The output of IC* is a marked pattern.

Two rules are used for this:

For each pair of nonadjacent nodes $a$ and $b$ with a common neighbor $c$:

1. if the link between $a$  and $c$ has an arrowhead into $c$ and if the link between $c$ and $b$ has no arrowhead into $c$, then add an arrowhead on the link between $c$ and $b$ pointing at $b$ and mark that link to obtain $c \rightarrow^{*} b$.
2. If $a$ and $b$ are adjacent and there is a directed path (composed strictly of marked links) from $a$  to $b$ (as in Figure 2.2), then add an arrowhead pointing toward $b$ on the link between $a$  and $b$.


Edge types
1. $a\rightarrow^{*} b$ : directed path
2. $a\rightarrow b$ : directed path or $a \leftarrow L \rightarrow b$
3. $a \longleftrightarrow b$: $a \leftarrow L \rightarrow b$
4. $a-b:$ $a \leftarrow L \rightarrow b$ or $a \leftarrow  b$ or $a \rightarrow b$
