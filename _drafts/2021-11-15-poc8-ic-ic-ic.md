DAGs like to play hide-and-seek. But we are more clever.

# Inferred Causation

We have arrived to the last piece before discussing causal discovery algorithms.

>Given $\hat{P}$, a variable $C$ has a causal influence on variable $E$ if and only if there exists a directed path from $C$ to $E$ in every minimal latent structure consistent with $\hat{P}$.
