Hitting the nail on its arrowhead, a.k.a. when does $X$ cause $Y$?

### PoC Post Series
- [PoC #8: Inferred Causation, $IC$, and ${IC}^*$](/posts/2021/11/poc8-ic-ic-ic)
- ➡️ [PoC #9: Potential, Genuine, Temporal Causes and Spurious Association](/posts/2021/11/poc9-causes/)

# Time-agnostic Relationships
$IC^*$ results in a PDAG with four edge types, as discussed in [PoC #8](/posts/2021/11/poc8-ic-ic-ic). We can think about those as expressing our "certainty" whether a relationship is causal:

1. $a\rightarrow^{*} b$: $a$ causes $b$
2. $a\rightarrow b$:  $a$ _potentially_ causes $b$
3. $a \leftrightarrow b$: $a$ and $b$ are _spuriously associated_
4. $a-b:$ we have no clue whether the relationship is causal or spurious (the direction is also unknown)

## Potential Cause
>$X$ is a **potential cause** of $Y$ (that is inferable from $P$) if:
>1. $X$ and $Y$ are dependent in every context ($X \not\perp Y | \forall S'$).
>2. There exists a variable $Z$ and a context $S:$ 
>    1. $X \perp Z | S$
>    2. $Y \not\perp Z | S$

- the conditions rule out $X\leftarrow Y$ as that would mean that $X \not\perp Z | S$ 


## Genuine Cause
>$X$ is the **genuine cause** of $Y$ if there exists a variable $Z$ such that either:
>1. $X$ and $Y$ are dependent in any context ($X \not\perp Y | \forall S'$) and $\exists$ context $S$:
>    1. $Z$ is a potential cause of $X$
>    2. $Y \not\perp Z | S$
>    3. $Y \perp Z | S \cup X$
>2. $X$ and $Y$ are in a transitive closure of criterion 1.

## Spurious Association
>$X$ and $Y$ are **spuriously associated** if $\exists$ variables $ Z_1, Z_2$ and contexts $S_1, S_2$:
>1. $X \not\perp Z_1 | S_1$
>2. $Y \perp Z_1 | S_1$
>3. $Y \not\perp Z_2 | S_2$
>4. $X \perp Z_2 | S_2$

# Time-dependent Relationships

- adjacent and preceding variables are potential casues
- adjacency not required if context precedes X

## Genuine Causation with Temporal Information
>$X$ is a **genuine cause** of $Y$ if there exists a variable $Z$ and a context $S$, both occurring before $X$, such that:
>1. $Y \not\perp Z | S$
>2. $Y \perp Z | S\cup X$

- temporal precedence makes Z a potential cause of X


## Define Spurious Association with Temporal Information
>$X$ and $Y$ are **spuriously associated** if $X \not\perp Y |S$ and $\exists Z:$ such that:
>1. $X$ precedes $Y$ 
>2. $Y \perp Z | S$
>3. $X \not\perp Z | S$

- no genuine cause as that would require dependent Z and Y
