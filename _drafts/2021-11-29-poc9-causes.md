We will talk about IC, $IC$, and ${IC}^*$ in this post. You get the difference.

## Potential Cause
$X$ has a potential causal influence on $Y$ (that is inferable from $P$) if:

$X$ and $Y$ are dependent in every context ($\not\perp_c$).
There exists a variable $Z$ and a context $S$ such that
$X \perp Z | S$
$Y \not\perp Z | S$


## Genuine Cause
$X$ has genuine causal influence on $Y$ if there exists a variable $Z$ such that either:
$X$ and $Y$ are dependent in any context ($\not\perp_c$) and $\exists$ context $S$:
$Z$ is a potential cause of $X$
$Y \not\perp Z | S$
$Y \perp Z | S \cup X$
$X$ and $Y$ are in a transitive closure of the relation of criterion 1.

## Spurious Association
$X$ and $Y$ are spuriously associated if $\exists$ variables $ Z_1, Z_2$ and contexts $S_1, S_2$:
$X \not\perp Z_1 | S_1$
$Y \perp Z_1 | S_1$
$Y \not\perp Z_2 | S_2$
$X \perp Z_2 | S_2$

## Genuine Causation with Temporal Information
$X$ has a causal influence on $Y$ if there is a third variable $Z$ and a context $S$,

both occurring before $X$, such that:

$Y \not\perp Z | S$
$Y \perp Z | S\cup X$

## Define Spurious Association with Temporal Information
$X$ and $Y$ are spuriously associated if $X \not\perp Y |S$:
if $X$ precedes $Y$ 
$\exists Z:$
$Y \perp Z | S$
$X \not\perp Z | S$
