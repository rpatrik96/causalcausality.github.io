Good resources matter, a _lot_.

# The need for ~~speed~~ good resources

DELETE STATS STUFF FROM CAUSALITY RESOURCES POST

>One of the most important steps _before_ starting to study a topic is to collect some good resources, Scott H. Young argues in his 2019 book [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/).


As a side note, I might—I mean, I will do this for sure—litter my posts with book references (actually, I am even planning to share the books I am reading with you in the near future).

But let's not permit ourselves to be distracted, let's get to the business!

As I agree with Scott, I invested some time to compile a list of materials, including lectures, books, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). I have already used some of these, but at least I familiarized myself with it enough to deem each and every item valuable. Let's get to the details, shall we?

# Statistics resources

## Books
- Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, [_The Book of Why_](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/): a gentle non-technical introduction into the topic with a lot of examples; definitely worth reading!



## MOOCs and online lectures
- [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics): an introductory course into Bayesian statistics. Besides covering the base (such as Bayes' theorem, Bayesian inference), it also discusses more advances topics as uninformative and Jeffreys priors. As a bonus, we get some insight how to apply the concepts in R.
