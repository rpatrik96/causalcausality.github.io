A PhD student's casual journey with causal inference.

# Welcome

Welcome to my journey! Since I started my PhD this April, I am working on causal inference. As my formal education did not prepare me for this, I set the goal myself to dive deep into causality.

This journey is far from finished, but I still invite you to join meâ€“I can promise a _casual_ tone (pun intended) and a lot of fun! Not to mention the additional benefit of learning cool things.
