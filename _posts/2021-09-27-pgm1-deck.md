To make learning probabilistic graphical models frictionless and more fun.

# Probabilistic Graphical Models 1 flashcards

Recently I started to study Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) on Coursera. 

As I have finished the lectures in the first course, I am releasing a deck of flashcards. This decks has been born because I needed something to practice the concept easily - I have never used flashcards before, but now I could not imagine learning about a complex topic without flashcards.

The link for the cards can be found on [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/49117877). After downloading the deck, you can import them into the free Anki software.

Happy learning and stay tuned for other decks to come!
