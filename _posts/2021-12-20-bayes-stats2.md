It's _again_ a statistics deck.

# Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models flashcards

I am now ready to pay my debt with the next flashcard deck, which accompanies a yet another statistics course, namely [Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcmc-bayesian-statistics) by Matthew Heiner on Coursera. 

The link for the cards can be found on [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/704366777). After downloading the deck, you can import them into the free Anki software. You can also access the deck in my earlier [resources post](/posts/2021/09/causality-resources/).

Happy learning and stay tuned for other decks to come!
