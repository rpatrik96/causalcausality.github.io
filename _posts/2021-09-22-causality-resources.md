Good resources matter, a _lot_.

# The need for ~~speed~~ good resources

>One of the most important steps _before_ starting to study a topic is to collect some good resources, Scott H. Young argues in his 2019 book [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/).


As a side note, I might—I mean, I will do this for sure—litter my posts with book references (actually, I am even planning to share the books I am reading with you in the near future).

But let's not permit ourselves to be distracted, let's get to the business!

As I agree with Scott, I invested some time to compile a list of materials, including lectures, books, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). I have already used some of these, but at least I familiarized myself with it enough to deem each and every item valuable. Let's get to the details, shall we?

# Causality resources

## Books
- Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, [_The Book of Why_](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/): a gentle non-technical introduction into the topic with a lot of examples; definitely worth reading!
- Judea Pearl, [_Causality_](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/) (2009) : this is THE classic textbook on the topic. It is not a very easy read, but it contains a vast amount of theoretical background. Nonetheless, a lot of times it refers to other papers for proofs, etc. - I found this reasonable but inconvenient. **Spoiler:** one of the goals of this blog is to get through this book and explain the concepts to develop a better understanding.
- Bernhard Schölkopf, Dominik Janzing, and Jonas Peters, [Elements of Causal Inference](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/26040/11283.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y): a recent **open-access** book that is keen on the theory of causal inference.
- Brady Neal, [_Introduction to Causal Inference from a Machine Learning Perspective_](https://www.bradyneal.com/Introduction_to_Causal_Inference-Dec17_2020-Neal.pdf) : this is the lecture notes for the online course _Introduction to Causal Inference_ (listed in the [MOOCs and online lectures](#moocs-and-online-lectures) section). Due to being lecture notes, I find this book to be more clearly cut, more structured, but it covers less material. Unfortunately, as of today, the book is still in progress-the most interesting (and advanced) chapters are still on their way.
- Miguel A. Hernán, James M. Robins, [Causal Inference: What if](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2019/10/ci_hernanrobins_1oct19.pdf): this **open-access** book is mainly aimed at social scientists and medical researchers (in the sense that the authors mainly discuss causality with concepts widely-used in those domains). Nevertheless, graphs (the choice of weapon for computer scientists) are also discussed in this very detailed book.


## MOOCs and online lectures
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models): this three-course feast presented by the famouse Daphne Koller provides you with the basics of traditional methods in graphical models. Although not causality-specific in its entirety, it lays the foundations, so definitely worth attending-it even provides programming assigments so you can get familiar with the methods. Aaaand it's totally **free** (if you are satisfied without a Coursera certificate).
- [Introduction to Causal Inference](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course): a causal inference course covering the fundamental topics. As it has the lecture notes released (see [Books](#books)), you should be well-equipped to take the challenge to become a causality expert.
- [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics): an introductory course into Bayesian statistics. Besides covering the base (such as Bayes' theorem, Bayesian inference), it also discusses more advances topics as uninformative and Jeffreys priors. As a bonus, we get some insight how to apply the concepts in R.
- Jonas Peter's Lectures on Causality [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo&ab_channel=BroadInstitute),  [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHOGP5o3Vu0&ab_channel=BroadInstitute), [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp4UcgpVA2I&ab_channel=BroadInstitute), [Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytnr_2dyyMU&ab_channel=BroadInstitute) from 2017, held at MIT: these are superb introductory lectures on the topics with a sense of humor and a lot of examples.
- [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/home?authuser=0): the name tells everything. This interdisciplinary seminar will provide you the  viewpoints of different scientific fields on causality. Let's exploit this unique opportunity to avoid falling into the bias of a single field's approach. The recordings are oalso available so you cannot make any excuse!
