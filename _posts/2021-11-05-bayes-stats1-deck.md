This blog discusses causal inference. _What is this post about Bayesian Statistics then?_

# Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis flashcards

You surely noticed that we are manipulating probability distributions all the time. But we only did them without considering any specific one. This is fine for our endeavor as it does not distract us from causal inference.

Nonetheless, when it comes to practice, we need sound knowledge of probabilities and statistics. I just did that when I enrolled in [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics) by Herbert Lee on Coursera. For I have finished the course it is time to release my deck of flashcards.

The link for the cards can be found on [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1326813205). After downloading the deck, you can import them into the free Anki software. You can also access the deck in my earlier [resources post](/posts/2021/09/causality-resources/).

Happy learning and stay tuned for other decks to come!
