Not just parameter learning, but learning about parameter learning got easier today. 

# Probabilistic Graphical Models 2 flashcards

I have just finished Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) on Coursera. Thus, it is time to release the last set of flashcards.

The link for the cards can be found on [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1251522498). After downloading the deck, you can import them into the free Anki software. You can also access the deck in my earlier [resources post](/posts/2021/09/causality-resources/).

Happy learning and stay tuned for other decks to come!
