# Probabilistic Graphical Models 2 flashcards

I am making progress with Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) on Coursera. As I finished watching the lectures in the second course -this one on inference methods-, it is time to release my deck of flashcards.

I might sound like a broken record, but these are helping me a lot: I can study everywhere, I cannot lose the materials, and I have an access to a "self-made mini encyclopedia" that can come handy if I need to loop up a definition or a theorem.

The link for the cards can be found on [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1002946770). After downloading the deck, you can import them into the free Anki software. You can also access the deck in my earlier [resources post](/posts/2021/09/causality-resources/).

Happy learning and stay tuned for other decks to come!
